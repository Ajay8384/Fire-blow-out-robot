It includes Arduino mega, sensors, servo motors, submersible water pump,motor driver and rubber wheels. Arduino mega is used as a micro-controller that connects other components. Motor driver is used to drive motors and is capable of running two DC motors (Left DC motor and Right DC motor) at the same time. This Robot uses three flame sensors for exact fire detection. This proposed model of Fire blow out Robot using Arduino used to detect presence of fire and extinguishing it automatically without any human interference.
